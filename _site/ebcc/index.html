<p>One impactful practicum project I had was my traditional and digital marketing practicum project.</p>

<p>Not only did my team help a local cidery, East Bower Cider Company <em>(EBCC)</em>, learn more about how to optimize their advertising to their target segmentation, I personally learned how to navigate difficulties and time management in a team setting. Let’s dive deeper!!</p>

<h1 style="color: #129256;">Key Takeaways</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Applying data science to a client-facing marketing-related project</li>
  <li>Utilizing NLP to enhance findings from a segmentation survey</li>
  <li>Working and leading a group to victory given multiple setbacks</li>
  <li>Creating business-level recommendations given data-powered insights</li>
  <li>Collating all information to put into an easy-to-digest powerpoint</li>
  <li>Personal growth!</li>
</ol>

<h1 style="color: #129256;">East Bower Practicum Findings</h1>

<p>My groups scope of the project was to see how EBCC’s target segmentation interacts with social media, more specifically, <em>where, why, and at what level</em>.</p>

<p><em>Down below you will find our presentation so you too can follow along!</em></p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Core Associations </h2>

<p>To start off, we looked at core associations relative to EBCC based off of menu offerings, current social media postings, and the overall atmosphere of the location. Additionally, we talked with the owners to see how they wanted their brand to be portrayed to the public. We found the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Values</strong> 🏘️
    <ul>
      <li><em>Transparency, Friendly, Inclusivity</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Atmosphere</strong> 🌃
    <ul>
      <li><em>Outdoor, Instagrammable, Music</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cider</strong> 🍻
    <ul>
      <li><em>Quality, Range of Products, Local</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now keep these values in mind, as they are important when it comes to the recommendations!</p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Our Target Segment</h2>

<p>To figure out who our customers are at a psychographic and behavioral level, our team analyzed Qualtrics survey data to uncover common patterns and reveal key findings. Additionally, we looked through the profiles of individuals that currently interact with EBCC on social media to uncover findings the data might have missed. From this, we found that middle aged men and women alike were very recpetive to EBCC! The image down below showcases our personas.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/assets/images/ebcc-personas.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/blog/assets/images/ebcc-personas.png" alt="EBCC Personas" style="width:100%;max-width:600px;" />
</a></p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Social Media Interaction</h2>

<p>When conducting netnography and analyzing popular posts and creative on EBCC’s social media, our team found that our uncovered target segmentation commonly uses Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok to keep up with local businesses, events, and brands. Additionally, colorful posts with people interacting with one another – whether its a friend, a loved one, or their dog – enjoying a drink gains a lot of traction!</p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Creative Media</h2>
<p>As our clients wanted to increase social media interaction, we came up with the following ideas and frameworks:</p>

<p><strong>1. Instagram Revamp</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Weekly calendar - <em>Give insights on what food trucks, events, and bands are happening in the next week</em></li>
  <li>Family-Oriented posts - <em>Urge families to bring their loved ones and come vibe</em></li>
  <li><strong>USER GENERATED CONTENT</strong>  - <em>Re-post photos that customers take. This is a HUGE vehicle for creative, as this shows people what exactly there is to expect</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Behind the Scenes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Process behing cider creation - <em>Something informational to entice the customer</em></li>
  <li>Employee takeovers - <em>It is way easier to enjoy a space and call it a ‘second home’ when there are familiar faces and recommendations</em></li>
  <li>After-event posts - <em>Show what events really look like, giving social media users a sense of FOMO</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Customer Interactions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer takeovers and testimonionals - Social media users feel safer when someone just like them are urging them to come visit</li>
</ul>

</a></p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Project Conclusion</h2>

<p>To answer the question of <em>where, why, and at what level</em>, we gave the following recommendations from our analysis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instagram is the most popular social media platform in current customers and future customers. A lot of locals utilize instagram for research on where to try next.</li>
  <li>Key metrics to aim for is 5200 Instagram followers and a 2-5% engagement rate</li>
  <li>User Generated Content is very important, as it shows customers on what to expect, making their visit a lot more comfortable</li>
  <li>Paid ads and organic content work hand-in-hand, you cannot have one or the other
    <ul>
      <li>Boosting ads in the RTP will not only increase interaction, but will also create a connection. Authentic content will further reinforce that connection</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Post more about customers interaction with the space and environment while they are enjoying a drink or grub
    <ul>
      <li>Customers want to feel like they are familiar with the space before visiting the actual storefront!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 style="color: #129256;">Personal Growth and Findings</h1>

<p>Not only did I grow my technical and consulting skills on this practicum project, I also learned more about where I can grow and how to approach certain scenarios for the future!</p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Time Management</h2>

<p>During this practicum project, I was juggling ~20 credit hours in this given semester. Additionally, I had another 2 other practicum projects. On top of that I was working 20 hours a week, grading assignments for my teaching assistant roles.</p>

<p>How did I manage all of this time effortlessly? I created a weekly schedule that notes what due dates I have coming up, what is needed to ensure I reach these deadlines, and most importantly, an urgency for each assignment. If I knew that I had more free time in a given week, I would use that time to close in the gaps of any due dates for the upcoming week. Additionally, I would use this urgency metric to finish most-important assignments first, and then work on lower-level assignments last. I also ensured I communicated effectively with my professors (that I worked for) and my peers/project members that I have a loaded schedule, but will be working effortlessly to get our work done in an orderly fashion and the utmost quality!</p>

<p>However, one issue arised. Abscent teammates.</p>

<h2 style="color: #d2691e;">Conflict in teams</h2>

<p>This practicum project as by far been the worst project I have worked on in a team setting. We started off strong, setting tasks and whatnot. But after a while, the progress of the whole team veered off task and the inputs of the team went downhill. The main issue here was not having a team lead and a reoccuring feedback system. Without a team lead, there is no direction of the project, and with no direction, the project goes nowhere.</p>

<p>To ensure our project gets to a point where our stakeholders are happy, I decided to take the role of team lead in the hopes that team members will still contribute. However, I was wrong. For the rest of the course of the project, it was just me and occasionally 2 group members. With the help of everyone, we would have had a brilliant presentation!</p>

<p>This project showed me that although you will be in a group setting a majority of the time, that does not necessarily mean everyone will want to do the work assigned or be active. Sometimes stepping up is key, and speaking up goes a long way!</p>
